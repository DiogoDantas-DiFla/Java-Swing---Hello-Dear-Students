# DIO Project Challenge - Creating Your First Repository on GitHub to Share Your Progress

This repository is a "Project Challenge" of the bootcamp "Orange Tech + | BackEnd" promoted by the course and bootcamp website called Digital Innovation One (DIO) with the objective of turning the students of this bootcamp into a Java developer. This Project Challenge consists of creating a repository on GitHub to share my progress, so I created a simple Java project using the Swing GUI to greet the students at the school where I am working at the time I am writing this text (I haven't given up on the Full Stack developer career yet, hence why I'm doing this bootcamp at Digital Innovation One) with popup messages.

## Prerequisites to run the project
- JDK 8+ (I'm using JDK 17)
- IDE for Java development (I'm using IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition version 2022.3.1)
- Know the basic syntax of Java and Swing GUI
